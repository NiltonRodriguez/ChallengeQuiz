# ChallengeQuiz

The current project is my solution to the Sofka U Technical Challenge for the Test Automation Training League.

### Disclamer
This repository is just intended to present own my solution. Remember that the main goal is to improve your coding abilities, so first try to solve the problems yourself.

## Description

In this challenge we are going to model a question and answer contest, the intention is to design a solution that allows having a question bank with different options for a single answer, in addition each question must be in a category or a group of similar questions of the same level, for each round a prize must be assigned to be achieved, the rounds of the game are levels that increase as the player wins prizes.
Within the challenge, the following should be considered:

- Management of classes or objects at the modeling level.
- Data persistence or history saving.
- Handling of lists or collections and adequate control cycles.
- Knowledge of any programming language.
- Git handling (control version).

## Instructions

This project is a command line game developed in Python 3.

Download and store all the files into the same directory.

Open a terminal window within the directory, then run the command:

    python3 main.py

(Or open the directory in an IDE or Code Editor and run main.py)

The welcome message describes the main instructions in the game.

First you will be prompted for your name. Type your name and press enter to start.

To answer each question type the option letter you choose and press enter.

After each question, if the option is correct, the prize is displayed. If the option is incorrect, the game ends and the results are displayed with the top 5 high scores.

After each question you will be asked to continue, type "S" to continue or "N" to end the game with your actual prize and press enter.
